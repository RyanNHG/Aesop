Each is distinguished\r\nby its own special characteristics.  The Tale consists simply\r\nin the narration of a story either founded on facts, or created\r\nsolely by the imagination, and not necessarily associated with\r\nthe teaching of any moral lesson.  The Parable is the designed\r\nuse of language purposely intended to convey a hidden and secret\r\nmeaning other than that contained in the words themselves; and\r\nwhich may or may not bear a special reference to the hearer,\r\nor reader.\r\n\r\n\tThe Fable partly agrees with, and partly differs from \r\nboth of these.  It will contain, like the Tale, a short but \r\nreal narrative; it will seek, like the Parable, to convey a \r\nhidden meaning, and that not so much by the use of language, \r\nas by the skilful introduction of fictitious characters; and \r\nyet unlike to either Tale or Parable, it will ever keep in \r\nview, as its high prerogative, and inseparable attribute, \r\nthe great purpose of instruction, and will necessarily seek \r\nto inculcate some moral maxim, social duty, or political truth.\r\n\r\n\tThe true Fable, if it rise to its high requirements, ever\r\naims at one great end and purpose representation of human \r\nmotive, and the improvement of human conduct, and yet it so \r\nconceals its design under the disguise of  fictitious \r\ncharacters, by clothing with speech the animals of the field,\r\nthe birds of the air, the trees of the wood, or the beasts \r\nof the forest, that the reader shall receive advice without\r\nperceiving the presence of the adviser.\r\n\r\n\tThus the superiority of the counsellor, which often renders \r\ncounsel unpalatable, is kept out of view, and the lesson comes\r\nwith the greater acceptance when the reader is led, unconsciously\r\nto himself, to have his sympathies enlisted in behalf of what \r\nis pure, honorable, and praiseworthy, and to have his indignation\r\nexcited against what is low, ignoble, and unworthy.  The true \r\nfabulist, therefore, discharges a most important function. \r\nHe is neither a narrator, nor an allegorist.  He is a great\r\nteacher, a corrector of morals, a censor of vice, and a \r\ncommender of virtue.\r\n\r\n\tIn this consists the superiority of the Fable over the Tale\r\nor the Parable.  The fabulist is to create a laugh, but yet, \r\nunder a merry guise, to convey instruction.\" \"The continual \r\nobservance of this twofold aim creates the charm, and accounts \r\nfor the universal favor, of the fables of Aesop.\r\n\r\n\tThe construction of a fable involves a minute attention \r\nto (1) the narration itself; (2) the deduction of the moral; \r\nand (3) a careful maintenance of the individual characteristics\r\nof the fictitious personages introduced into it.  The narration\r\nshould relate to one simple action, consistent with itself, \r\nand neither be overladen with a multiplicity of details, nor\r\n distracted by a variety of circumstances. The moral or \r\nlesson should be so plain, and so intimately interwoven with,\r\nand so necessarily dependent on, the narration, that every \r\nreader should be compelled to give to it the same undeniable\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\n\tThe introduction of the animals or fictitious characters \r\nshould be marked with an unexceptionable care and attention \r\nto their natural attributes, and to the qualities attributed \r\nto them by universal popular consent. The Fox should be \r\nalways cunning, the Hare timid, the Lion bold, the Wolf \r\ncruel, the Bull strong, the Horse proud, and the Ass patient.\r\nMany of these fables are characterized by the strictest \r\nobservance of these rules.  They are occupied with one \r\nshort narrative, from which the moral naturally flows, \r\nand with which it is intimately associated.\r\n"},{"title":"The Ant and the Dove","moral":"One good turn deserves another","body":"\n\r\n  The Ant and the Dove \r\n\r\n\r\n  AN ANT went to the bank of a river to quench its thirst, and\r\nbeing carried away by the rush of the stream, was on the point of\r\ndrowning.

Perhaps it is most notable\r\nthat Socrates is said to have passed his time awaiting\r\nexecution by putting Aesop's fables into verse.  As it is\r\nunlikely that the early remarks on Aesop have no foundation in\r\nreality, it can cautiously be said that Aesop was probably a\r\nslave in the sixth century B.C., that he probably came from\r\nPhrygia and then lived in Samos, that he had a knack for\r\n\"fables\" (logoi) and that he became famous and gained his\r\nfreedom on this account.  The story that he was put to death\r\nby being pushed off a cliff in Delphi because he insulted the\r\nDelphians is already current in the fifth century B.C.\r\n\r\n   Beyond this, it is difficult to say much about the actual\r\nAesop.  Especially as he quickly becomes a mythical figure to\r\nwhom fables are automatically ascribed, much in the way that\r\nwe automatically ascribe nursery rhymes to Mother Goose.\r\n\r\n   Though the real Aesop is likely to remain obscure and\r\ninacessible, there is a famous LIFE OF AESOP which has \r\nbeen popular reading for thousands of years and exists in a\r\nfascinating, if sometimes bewildering, array of variants.  Up\r\nuntil the nineteenth century, it was believed that this\r\nbiography was invented by Maximus Planudes, a monk of\r\nConstantinople, in the fourteenth century.  While this view of\r\nthe origin of the LIFE OF AESOP is still sometimes \r\nexpressed, it is no longer viable, as Ben Edwin Perry has \r\nedited an ancient version of THE LIFE which dates from \r\nRoman times, a thousand years before Maximus himself existed.\r\n\r\n   Perry's work shows that the LIFE OF AESOP is an ancient\r\nbook, but beyond this it is difficult to say.  M.L. West has\r\nsuggested that a prototype of the book existed by the end of\r\nthe fifth century B.C. and a German scholarship once held that\r\nit began as an Ionian \"folkbook\" in the sixth century B.C. \r\nWhatever one decides in this regard, much of the material in\r\nthe book is very old.  The fables it contains are, for\r\nexample, primarily 'aetiological' fables which are intended to\r\nexplain the causes of particular natural phenomena occur. \r\nOne, for example, explains that weeds grow so much better than\r\ndomesticated plants because they are the natural offspring of\r\nthe Earth and she favours them, just as a mother will\r\nnaturally favour her own children over children others ask her\r\nto tend. The moral fables we ourselves associate with Aesop\r\n(fables which teach us how we should behave) are, in contrast,\r\nless prominent.\r\n\r\n   While the story in the LIFE OF AESOP (which has, in \r\nits earliest version, the title \"THE BOOK OF XANTHUS \r\nTHE PHILOSOPHER AND HIS SLAVE AESOP\") cannot with \r\nconfidence be said to reflect Aesop's actual life, it is an \r\nintriguing read. It tells how Aesop was an ugly slave who \r\ncould not speak but was granted the power to speak in return\r\nfor his generosity to one of the god Isis' attendants.  He \r\nthen engineers his way to Samos, where he becomes the slave \r\nof the philosopher Xanthus. There follow a series of wild \r\nstories, witty fables and a few improper episodes which \r\ndemonstrates, above all else, that Aesop is smarter than \r\nXanthus.  His cleverness is on one occasion demonstrated by \r\nhis ability to find a way to save Xanthus from a foolish \r\nwager he makes at a party, where he bets that he can drink \r\nthe sea dry.  When the man who has bet against him (and is \r\neagerly awaiting his reward) agrees that Xanthus need only \r\ndrink the sea dry (and not a drop of water from elsewhere) \r\nthe bet is rendered null and void because he cannot stop all \r\nthe rivers from flowing into it.\r\n\r\n   The different versions of the LIFE result both because \r\nits many different editors and publisher tell the same story \r\nin different words, and because they sometimes eliminate\r\nincidents they regard as improper (some very adult jokes, for\r\nexample).  Certainly the book has the flavour of a Roman\r\nsatire and has in view of this tried the patience of many. \r\nThere exasperation with the book is reflected in\r\npronouncements like the Reverend George Fyler Townsend's\r\nnineteenth century remark that \"This life by Planudes\r\ncontains... so small an amount of truth, and is so full of\r\nabsurd pictures of the grotesque deformity of Aesop, of\r\nwondrous apocryphal stories, of lying legends, and gross\r\nanachronisms, that it is now universally condemned as false,\r\npuerile, and unathentic.  It is given up in the present day\r\nand unworthy of the slightest credit.\" (THREE HUNDRED \r\nAESOP'S FABLES, London: George Routledge & Sons, 1867, \r\np. xxviii)\r\n\r\n   One might nevertheless answer that the LIFE OF AESOP \r\nstill makes entertaining reading, something that explains \r\nwhich it has been continuously in print for more than two \r\nthousand years (a publication history that rivals that of \r\nalmost any book). For those interested in THE LIFE OF \r\nAESOP, the most accurate translation is in Lloyd Daly, \r\nAESOP WITHOUT MORALS (New York: Thomas Yoseloff, 1961). \r\nLa Fontaine's version of Planudes account is also available \r\nin many editions.  One will find many other variants in \r\ntraditional collections of fables -- so *many* that Sir \r\nRoger L'Estrange already complained in the preface to his \r\n1692 version that the LIFE OF AESOP had been \"dress'd up\" \r\nin so many different ways that it is impossible to say \r\nanything with certainty on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tLeo Groarke Wilfrid\r\n\tLaurier University\r\n\r\n\tFeb 18, 1998\r\n"},{"title":"The Ass and the Wolf","moral":".","body":"\n\r\n  The Ass and the Wolf \r\n\r\n\r\n  AN ASS feeding in a meadow saw a Wolf approaching to seize him,\r\nand immediately pretended to be lame.

This report being spread about\r\nmade a great stir, and the theater was crowded in every part. \r\nThe Buffoon appeared alone upon the platform, without any\r\napparatus or confederates, and the very sense of expectation\r\ncaused an intense silence.

Sardis, the\r\ncapital of Lydia; Samos, a Greek island; Mesembria, an ancient\r\ncolony in Thrace; and Cotiaeum, the chief city of a province of\r\nPhrygia, contend for the distinction of being the birthplace of\r\nAesop.  Although the honor thus claimed cannot be definitely\r\nassigned to any one of these places, yet there are a few\r\nincidents now generally accepted by scholars as established\r\nfacts, relating to the birth, life, and death of Aesop.  He is,\r\nby an almost universal consent, allowed to have been born about\r\nthe year 620 B.C., and to have been by birth a slave.  He was\r\nowned by two masters in succession, both inhabitants of Samos,\r\nXanthus and Jadmon, the latter of whom gave him his liberty as a\r\nreward for his learning and wit.  One of the privileges of a\r\nfreedman in the ancient republics of Greece, was the permission\r\nto take an active interest in public affairs; and Aesop, like the\r\nphilosophers Phaedo, Menippus, and Epictetus, in later times,\r\nraised himself from the indignity of a servile condition to a\r\nposition of high renown.  In his desire alike to instruct and to\r\nbe instructed, he travelled through many countries, and among\r\nothers came to Sardis, the capital of the famous king of Lydia,\r\nthe great patron, in that day, of learning and of learned men. \r\nHe met at the court of Croesus with Solon, Thales, and other\r\nsages, and is related so to have pleased his royal master, by the\r\npart he took in the conversations held with these philosophers,\r\nthat he applied to him an expression which has since passed into\r\na proverb, \"The Phrygian has spoken better than all.\"  \r\n \r\nOn the invitation of Croesus he fixed his residence at Sardis,\r\nand was employed by that monarch in various difficult and\r\ndelicate affairs of State.  In his discharge of these commissions\r\nhe visited the different petty republics of Greece.  At one time\r\nhe is found in Corinth, and at another in Athens, endeavouring,\r\nby the narration of some of his wise fables, to reconcile the\r\ninhabitants of those cities to the administration of their\r\nrespective rulers Periander and Pisistratus.  One of these\r\nambassadorial missions, undertaken at the command of Croesus, was\r\nthe occasion of his death.  Having been sent to Delphi with a\r\nlarge sum of gold for distribution among the citizens, he was so\r\nprovoked at their covetousness that he refused to divide the\r\nmoney, and sent it back to his master.  The Delphians, enraged at\r\nthis treatment, accused him of impiety, and, in spite of his\r\nsacred character as ambassador, executed him as a public\r\ncriminal.  This cruel death of Aesop was not unavenged.  The\r\ncitizens of Delphi were visited with a series of calamities,\r\nuntil they made a public reparation of their crime; and, \"The\r\nblood of Aesop\" became a well- \r\nknown adage, bearing witness to the truth that deeds of wrong\r\nwould not pass unpunished.  Neither did the great fabulist lack\r\nposthumous honors; for a statue was erected to his memory at\r\nAthens, the work of Lysippus, one of the most famous of Greek\r\nsculptors.  Phaedrus thus immortalizes the event:\r\n\r\nAesopo ingentem statuam posuere Attici,\r\nServumque collocarunt aeterna in basi:  \r\nPatere honoris scirent ut cuncti viam; \r\nNec generi tribui sed virtuti gloriam.\r\n \r\nThese few facts are all that can be relied on with any degree of\r\ncertainty, in reference to the birth, life, and death of Aesop. \r\nThey were first brought to light, after a patient search and\r\ndiligent perusal of ancient authors, by a Frenchman, M. Claude\r\nGaspard Bachet de Mezeriac, who declined the honor of being\r\ntutor to Louis XIII of France, from his desire to devote himself\r\nexclusively to literature.  He published his Life of Aesop, Anno\r\nDomini 1632.  The later investigations of a host of English and\r\nGerman scholars have added very little to the facts given by M.\r\nMezeriac.  The substantial truth of his statements has been\r\nconfirmed by later criticism and inquiry.  It remains to state,\r\nthat prior to this publication of M. Mezeriac, the life of Aesop\r\nwas from the pen of Maximus Planudes, a monk of Constantinople,\r\nwho was sent on an embassy to Venice by the Byzantine Emperor\r\nAndronicus the elder, and who wrote in the early part of the\r\nfourteenth century.  His life was prefixed to all the early\r\neditions of these fables, and was republished as late as 1727 by\r\nArchdeacon Croxall as the introduction to his edition of Aesop. \r\nThis life by Planudes contains, however, so small an amount of\r\ntruth, and is so full of absurd pictures of the grotesque\r\ndeformity of Aesop, of wondrous apocryphal stories, of lying\r\nlegends, and gross anachronisms, that it is now universally\r\ncondemned as false, puerile, and unauthentic.  l It is given up\r\nin the present day, by general consent, as unworthy of the\r\nslightest credit.  \r\nG.F.T.  \r\n \r\n1 M. Bayle thus characterises this Life of Aesop by Planudes,\r\n\"Tous les habiles gens conviennent que c'est un roman, et que les\r\nabsurdites grossieres qui l'on y trouve le rendent indigne de\r\ntoute.\"\r\nDictionnaire Historique.

Each is distinguished by its own\r\nspecial characteristics.  The Tale consists simply in the\r\nnarration of a story either founded on facts, or created solely\r\nby the imagination, and not necessarily associated with the\r\nteaching of any moral lesson.  The Parable is the designed use of\r\nlanguage purposely intended to convey a hidden and secret\r\nmeaning other than that contained in the words themselves; and\r\nwhich may or may not bear a special reference to the hearer, or\r\nreader.  The Fable partly agrees with, and partly differs from\r\nboth of these.  It will contain, like the Tale, a short but real\r\nnarrative; it will seek, like the Parable, to convey a hidden\r\nmeaning, and that not so much by the use of language, as by the\r\nskilful introduction of fictitious characters; and yet unlike to\r\neither Tale or Parable, it will ever keep in view, as its high\r\nprerogative, and inseparable attribute, the great purpose of\r\ninstruction, and will necessarily seek to inculcate some moral\r\nmaxim, social duty, or political truth.  The true Fable, if it\r\nrise to its high requirements, ever aims at one great end and\r\npurpose representation of human motive, and the improvement of\r\nhuman conduct, and yet it so conceals its design under the\r\ndisguise of fictitious characters, by clothing with speech the\r\nanimals of the field, the birds of the air, the trees of the\r\nwood, or the beasts of the forest, that the reader shall receive\r\nadvice without perceiving the presence of the adviser.  Thus the\r\nsuperiority of the counsellor, which often renders counsel\r\nunpalatable, is kept out of view, and the lesson comes with the\r\ngreater acceptance when the reader is led, unconsciously to\r\nhimself, to have his sympathies enlisted in behalf of what is\r\npure, honorable, and praiseworthy, and to have his indignation\r\nexcited against what is low, ignoble, and unworthy.  The true\r\nfabulist, therefore, discharges a most important function.  He is\r\nneither a narrator, nor an allegorist.  He is a great teacher, a\r\ncorrector of morals, a censor of vice, and a commender of virtue. \r\nIn this consists the superiority of the Fable over the Tale or\r\nthe Parable.  The fabulist is to create a laugh, but yet, under a\r\nmerry guise, to convey instruction.  Phaedrus, the great imitator\r\nof Aesop, plainly indicates this double purpose to be the true\r\noffice of the writer of fables.  \r\n \r\nDuplex libelli dos est:  quod risum movet, \r\nEt quod prudenti vitam consilio monet.  \r\n \r\nThe continual observance of this twofold aim creates the charm,\r\nand accounts for the universal favor, of the fables of Aesop. \r\n\"The fable,\" says Professor K. O. Mueller, \"originated in Greece\r\nin an intentional travestie of human affairs.  The 'ainos,' as\r\nits name denotes, is an admonition, or rather a reproof veiled,\r\neither from fear of an excess of frankness, or from a love of fun\r\nand jest, beneath the fiction of an occurrence happening among\r\nbeasts; and wherever we have any ancient and authentic account of\r\nthe Aesopian fables, we find it to be the same.\"  l \r\n \r\nThe construction of a fable involves a minute attention to (1)\r\nthe narration itself; (2) the deduction of the moral; and (3) a\r\ncareful maintenance of the individual characteristics of the\r\nfictitious personages introduced into it.  The narration should\r\nrelate to one simple action, consistent with itself, and neither\r\nbe overladen with a multiplicity of details, nor distracted by a\r\nvariety of circumstances.  The moral or lesson should be so\r\nplain, and so intimately interwoven with, and so necessarily\r\ndependent on, the narration, that every reader should be\r\ncompelled to give to it the same undeniable interpretation.  The\r\nintroduction of the animals or fictitious characters should be\r\nmarked with an unexceptionable care and attention to their\r\nnatural attributes, and to the qualities attributed to them by\r\nuniversal popular consent.  The Fox should be always cunning, the\r\nHare timid, the Lion bold, the Wolf cruel, the Bull strong, the\r\nHorse proud, and the Ass patient.  Many of these fables are\r\ncharacterized by the strictest observance of these rules.  They\r\nare occupied with one short narrative, from which the moral\r\nnaturally flows, and with which it is intimately associated. \r\n\"'Tis the simple manner,\" says Dodsley, 2 \"in which the morals of\r\nAesop are interwoven with his fables that distinguishes him, and\r\ngives him the preference over all other mythologists.  His\r\n'Mountain delivered of a Mouse,' produces the moral of his fable\r\nin ridicule of pompous pretenders; and his Crow, when she drops\r\nher cheese, lets fall, as it were by accident, the strongest\r\nadmonition against the power of flattery.  There is no need of a\r\nseparate sentence to explain it; no possibility of impressing it\r\ndeeper, by that load we too often see of accumulated\r\nreflections.\"  3 An equal amount of praise is due for the\r\nconsistency with which the characters of the animals,\r\nfictitiously introduced, are marked.  While they are made to\r\ndepict the motives and passions of men, they retain, in an\r\neminent degree, their own special features of craft or counsel,\r\nof cowardice or courage, of generosity or rapacity.  \r\n \r\nThese terms of praise, it must be confessed, cannot be bestowed\r\non all the fables in this collection.  Many of them lack that\r\nunity of design, that close connection of the moral with the\r\nnarrative, that wise choice in the introduction of the animals,\r\nwhich constitute the charm and excellency of true Aesopian fable. \r\nThis inferiority of some to others is sufficiently accounted for\r\nin the history of the origin and descent of these fables.  The\r\ngreat bulk of them are not the immediate work of Aesop.  Many are\r\nobtained from ancient authors prior to the time in which he\r\nlived.  Thus, the fable of the \"Hawk and the Nightingale\" is\r\nrelated by Hesiod; 4 the \"Eagle wounded by an Arrow, winged with\r\nits own Feathers,\" by Aeschylus; 5 the \"Fox avenging his wrongs\r\non the Eagle,\" by Archilochus.  6 Many of them again are of later\r\norigin, and are to be traced to the monks of the middle ages:  and\r\nyet this collection, though thus made up of fables both earlier\r\nand later than the era of Aesop, rightfully bears his name,\r\nbecause he composed so large a number (all framed in the same\r\nmould, and conformed to the same fashion, and stamped with the\r\nsame lineaments, image, and superscription) as to secure to\r\nhimself the right to be considered the father of Greek fables,\r\nand the founder of this class of writing, which has ever since\r\nborne his name, and has secured for him, through all succeeding\r\nages, the position of the first of moralists.7 \r\n \r\nThe fables were in the first instance only narrated by Aesop, and\r\nfor a long time were handed down by the uncertain channel of oral\r\ntradition.  Socrates is mentioned by Plato 8 as having employed\r\nhis time while in prison, awaiting the return of the sacred ship\r\nfrom Delphos which was to be the signal of his death, in turning\r\nsome of these fables into verse, but he thus versified only such\r\nas he remembered.  Demetrius Phalereus, a philosopher at Athens\r\nabout 300 B.C., is said to have made the first collection of\r\nthese fables.  Phaedrus, a slave by birth or by subsequent\r\nmisfortunes, and admitted by Augustus to the honors of a\r\nfreedman, imitated many of these fables in Latin iambics about\r\nthe commencement of the Christian era.  Aphthonius, a rhetorician\r\nof Antioch, A.D. 315, wrote a treatise on, and converted into\r\nLatin prose, some of these fables.  This translation is the more\r\nworthy of notice, as it illustrates a custom of common use, both\r\nin these and in later times.  The rhetoricians and philosophers\r\nwere accustomed to give the Fables of Aesop as an exercise to\r\ntheir scholars, not only inviting them to discuss the moral of\r\nthe tale, but also to practice and to perfect themselves thereby\r\nin style and rules of grammar, by making for themselves new and\r\nvarious versions of the fables.  Ausonius, 9 the friend of the\r\nEmperor Valentinian, and the latest poet of eminence in the\r\nWestern Empire, has handed down some of these fables in verse,\r\nwhich Julianus Titianus, a contemporary writer of no great name,\r\ntranslated into prose.  Avienus, also a contemporary of Ausonius,\r\nput some of these fables into Latin elegiacs, which are given by\r\nNevelet (in a book we shall refer to hereafter), and are\r\noccasionally incorporated with the editions of Phaedrus.  \r\n \r\nSeven centuries elapsed before the next notice is found of the\r\nFables of Aesop.  During this long period these fables seem to\r\nhave suffered an eclipse, to have disappeared and to have been\r\nforgotten; and it is at the commencement of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, when the Byzantine emperors were the great patrons of\r\nlearning, and amidst the splendors of an Asiatic court, that we\r\nnext find honors paid to the name and memory of Aesop.  Maximus\r\nPlanudes, a learned monk of Constantinople, made a collection of\r\nabout a hundred and fifty of these fables.  Little is known of\r\nhis history.  Planudes, however, was no mere recluse, shut up in\r\nhis monastery.  He took an active part in public affairs.  In\r\n1327 A.D.  he was sent on a diplomatic mission to Venice by the\r\nEmperor Andronicus the Elder.  This brought him into immediate\r\ncontact with the Western Patriarch, whose interests he henceforth\r\nadvocated with so much zeal as to bring on him suspicion and\r\npersecution from the rulers of the Eastern Church.  Planudes has\r\nbeen exposed to a two-fold accusation.  He is charged on the one\r\nhand with having had before him a copy of Babrias (to whom we\r\nshall have occasion to refer at greater length in the end of this\r\nPreface), and to have had the bad taste \"to transpose,\" or to\r\nturn his poetical version into prose:  and he is asserted, on the\r\nother hand, never to have seen the Fables of Aesop at all, but to\r\nhave himself invented and made the fables which he palmed off\r\nunder the name of the famous Greek fabulist.  The truth lies\r\nbetween these two extremes.  Planudes may have invented some few\r\nfables, or have inserted some that were current in his day; but\r\nthere is an abundance of unanswerable internal evidence to prove\r\nthat he had an acquaintance with the veritable fables of Aesop,\r\nalthough the versions he had access to were probably corrupt, as\r\ncontained in the various translations and disquisitional\r\nexercises of the rhetoricians and philosophers.  His collection\r\nis interesting and important, not only as the parent source or\r\nfoundation of the earlier printed versions of Aesop, but as the\r\ndirect channel of attracting to these fables the attention of the\r\nlearned.  \r\n \r\nThe eventual re-introduction, however, of these Fables of Aesop\r\nto their high place in the general literature of Christendom, is\r\nto be looked for in the West rather than in the East.  The\r\ncalamities gradually thickening round the Eastern Empire, and the\r\nfall of Constantinople, 1453 A.D.  combined with other events to\r\npromote the rapid restoration of learning in Italy; and with that\r\nrecovery of learning the revival of an interest in the Fables of\r\nAesop is closely identified.  These fables, indeed, were among\r\nthe first writings of an earlier antiquity that attracted\r\nattention.  They took their place beside the Holy Scriptures and\r\nthe ancient classic authors, in the minds of the great students\r\nof that day.  Lorenzo Valla, one of the most famous promoters of\r\nItalian learning, not only translated into Latin the Iliad of\r\nHomer and the Histories of Herodotus and Thucydides, but also the\r\nFables of Aesop.  \r\n \r\nThese fables, again, were among the books brought into an\r\nextended circulation by the agency of the printing press.  Bonus\r\nAccursius, as early as 1475-1480, printed the collection of these\r\nfables, made by Planudes, which, within five years afterwards,\r\nCaxton translated into English, and printed at his press in West-\r\nminster Abbey, 1485.  10 It must be mentioned also that the\r\nlearning of this age has left permanent traces of its influence\r\non these fables, ll by causing the interpolation with them of\r\nsome of those amusing stories which were so frequently introduced\r\ninto the public discourses of the great preachers of those days,\r\nand of which specimens are yet to be found in the extant sermons\r\nof Jean Raulin, Meffreth, and Gabriel Barlette.   12 The\r\npublication of this era which most probably has influenced these\r\nfables, is the \"Liber Facetiarum,\" l3 a book consisting of a\r\nhundred jests and stories, by the celebrated Poggio Bracciolini,\r\npublished A.D.  1471, from which the two fables of the \"Miller,\r\nhis Son, and the Ass,\" and the \"Fox and the Woodcutter,\" are\r\nundoubtedly selected.  \r\n \r\nThe knowledge of these fables rapidly spread from Italy into\r\nGermany, and their popularity was increased by the favor and\r\nsanction given to them by the great fathers of the Reformation,\r\nwho frequently used them as vehicles for satire and protest\r\nagainst the tricks and abuses of the Romish ecclesiastics.  The\r\nzealous and renowned Camerarius, who took an active part in the\r\npreparation of the Confession of Augsburgh, found time, amidst\r\nhis numerous avocations, to prepare a version for the students in\r\nthe university of Tubingen, in which he was a professor.  Martin\r\nLuther translated twenty of these fables, and was urged by\r\nMelancthon to complete the whole; while Gottfried Arnold, the\r\ncelebrated Lutheran theologian, and librarian to Frederick I,\r\nking of Prussia, mentions that the great Reformer valued the\r\nFables of Aesop next after the Holy Scriptures.  In 1546 A.D. \r\nthe second printed edition of the collection of the Fables made\r\nby Planudes, was issued from the printing-press of Robert\r\nStephens, in which were inserted some additional fables from a\r\nMS. in the Bibliotheque du Roy at Paris.  \r\n \r\nThe greatest advance, however, towards a re-introduction of the\r\nFables of Aesop to a place in the literature of the world, was\r\nmade in the early part of the seventeenth century.  In the year\r\n1610, a learned Swiss, Isaac Nicholas Nevelet, sent forth the\r\nthird printed edition of these fables, in a work entitled\r\n\"Mythologia Aesopica.\"  This was a noble effort to do honor to\r\nthe great fabulist, and was the most perfect collection of\r\nAesopian fables ever yet published.  It consisted, in addition to\r\nthe collection of fables given by Planudes and reprinted in the\r\nvarious earlier editions, of one hundred and thirty-six new\r\nfables (never before published) from MSS.  in the Library of the\r\nVatican, of forty fables attributed to Aphthonius, and of\r\nforty-three from Babrias.  It also contained the Latin versions\r\nof the same fables by Phaedrus, Avienus, and other authors.  This\r\nvolume of Nevelet forms a complete \"Corpus Fabularum\r\nAesopicarum;\" and to his labors Aesop owes his restoration to\r\nuniversal favor as one of the wise moralists and great teachers\r\nof mankind.  During the interval of three centuries which has\r\nelapsed since the publication of this volume of Nevelet's, no\r\nbook, with the exception of the Holy Scriptures, has had a wider\r\ncirculation than Aesop's Fables.  They have been translated into\r\nthe greater number of the languages both of Europe and of the\r\nEast, and have been read, and will be read, for generations,\r\nalike by Jew, Heathen, Mohammedan, and Christian.  They are, at\r\nthe present time, not only engrafted into the literature of the\r\ncivilized world, but are familiar as household words in the\r\ncommon intercourse and daily conversation of the inhabitants of\r\nall countries.  \r\n \r\nThis collection of Nevelet's is the great culminating point in\r\nthe history of the revival of the fame and reputation of Aesopian\r\nFables.  It is remarkable, also, as containing in its preface the\r\ngerm of an idea, which has been since proved to have been correct\r\nby a strange chain of circumstances.  Nevelet intimates an\r\nopinion, that a writer named Babrias would be found to be the\r\nveritable author of the existing form of Aesopian Fables.  This\r\nintimation has since given rise to a series of inquiries, the\r\nknowledge of which is necessary, in the present day, to a full\r\nunderstanding of the true position of Aesop in connection with\r\nthe writings that bear his name.  \r\n \r\nThe history of Babrias is so strange and interesting, that it\r\nmight not unfitly be enumerated among the curiosities of\r\nliterature.  He is generally supposed to have been a Greek of\r\nAsia Minor, of one of the Ionic Colonies, but the exact period in\r\nwhich he lived and wrote is yet unsettled.  He is placed, by one\r\ncritic, l4 as far back as the institution of the Achaian League,\r\nB.C.  250; by another as late as the Emperor Severus, who died\r\nA.D.  235; while others make him a contemporary with Phaedrus in\r\nthe time of Augustus.  At whatever time he wrote his version of\r\nAesop, by some strange accident it seems to have entirely\r\ndisappeared, and to have been lost sight of.  His name is\r\nmentioned by Avienus; by Suidas, a celebrated critic, at the\r\nclose of the eleventh century, who gives in his lexicon several\r\nisolated verses of his version of the fables; and by John\r\nTzetzes, a grammarian and poet of Constantinople, who lived\r\nduring the latter half of the twelfth century.  Nevelet, in the\r\npreface to the volume which we have described, points out that\r\nthe Fables of Planudes could not be the work of Aesop, as they\r\ncontain a reference in two places to \"Holy monks,\" and give a\r\nverse from the Epistle of St.  James as an \"Epimith\" to one of\r\nthe fables, and suggests Babrias as their author.  Francis\r\nVavassor, 15 a learned French jesuit, entered at greater length\r\non this subject, and produced further proofs from internal\r\nevidence, from the use of the word Piraeus in describing the\r\nharbour of Athens, a name which was not given till two hundred\r\nyears after Aesop, and from the introduction of other modern\r\nwords, that many of these fables must have been at least\r\ncommitted to writing posterior to the time of Aesop, and more\r\nboldly suggests Babrias as their author or collector.  16 These\r\nvarious references to Babrias induced Dr. Plichard Bentley, at\r\nthe close of the seventeenth century, to examine more minutely\r\nthe existing versions of Aesop's Fables, and he maintained that\r\nmany of them could, with a slight change of words, be resolved\r\ninto the Scazonic l7 iambics, in which Babrias is known to have\r\nwritten:  and, with a greater freedom than the evidence then\r\njustified, he put forth, in behalf of Babrias, a claim to the\r\nexclusive authorship of these fables.  Such a seemingly\r\nextravagant theory, thus roundly asserted, excited much\r\nopposition.  Dr. Bentley l8 met with an able antagonist in a\r\nmember of the University of Oxford, the Hon.  Mr.  Charles Boyle,\r\n19 afterwards Earl of Orrery.  Their letters and disputations on\r\nthis subject, enlivened on both sides with much wit and learning,\r\nwill ever bear a conspicuous place in the literary history of the\r\nseventeenth century.  The arguments of Dr. Bentley were yet\r\nfurther defended a few years later by Mr.  Thomas Tyrwhitt, a\r\nwell-read scholar, who gave up high civil distinctions that he\r\nmight devote himself the more unreservedly to literary pursuits. \r\nMr.  Tyrwhitt published, A.D.  1776, a Dissertation on Babrias,\r\nand a collection of his fables in choliambic meter found in a MS. \r\nin the Bodleian Library at Oxford.  Francesco de Furia, a learned\r\nItalian, contributed further testimony to the correctness of the\r\nsupposition that Babrias had made a veritable collection of\r\nfables by printing from a MS.  contained in the Vatican library\r\nseveral fables never before published.  In the year 1844,\r\nhowever, new and unexpected light was thrown upon this subject. \r\nA veritable copy of Babrias was found in a manner as singular as\r\nwere the MSS.  of Quinctilian's Institutes, and of Cicero's\r\nOrations by Poggio in the monastery of St.  Gall A.D.  1416.  M.\r\nMenoides, at the suggestion of M. Villemain, Minister of Public\r\nInstruction to King Louis Philippe, had been entrusted with a\r\ncommission to search for ancient MSS., and in carrying out his\r\ninstructions he found a MS.  at the convent of St.  Laura, on\r\nMount Athos, which proved to be a copy of the long suspected and\r\nwished-for choliambic version of Babrias.  This MS.  was found to\r\nbe divided into two books, the one containing a hundred and\r\ntwenty-five, and the other ninety-five fables.  This discovery\r\nattracted very general attention, not only as confirming, in a\r\nsingular manner, the conjectures so boldly made by a long chain\r\nof critics, but as bringing to light valuable literary treasures\r\ntending to establish the reputation, and to confirm the antiquity\r\nand authenticity of the great mass of Aesopian Fable.  The Fables\r\nthus recovered were soon published.  They found a most worthy\r\neditor in the late distinguished Sir George Cornewall Lewis, and\r\na translator equally qualified for his task, in the Reverend\r\nJames Davies, M.A., sometime a scholar of Lincoln College,\r\nOxford, and himself a relation of their English editor.  Thus,\r\nafter an eclipse of many centuries, Babrias shines out as the\r\nearliest, and most reliable collector of veritable Aesopian\r\nFables.  \r\n \r\nThe following are the sources from which the present translation\r\nhas been prepared:     Babrii Fabulae Aesopeae.

Birmingham, 1864.  P.  60.  \r\n3 Some of these fables had, no doubt, in the first instance, a\r\nprimary and private interpretation.  On the first occasion of\r\ntheir being composed they were intended to refer to some passing\r\nevent, or to some individual acts of wrong-doing.  Thus, the\r\nfables of the \"Eagle and the Fox\" and of the \"Fox and Monkey' are\r\nsupposed to have been written by Archilochus, to avenge the\r\ninjuries done him by Lycambes.  So also the fables of the\r\n\"Swollen Fox\" and of the \"Frogs asking a King\" were spoken by\r\nAesop for the immediate purpose of reconciling the inhabitants of\r\nSamos and Athens to their respective rulers, Periander and\r\nPisistratus; while the fable of the \"Horse and Stag\" was composed\r\nto caution the inhabitants of Himera against granting a bodyguard\r\nto Phalaris.  In a similar manner, the fable from Phaedrus, the\r\n\"Marriage of the Sun,\" is supposed to have reference to the\r\ncontemplated union of Livia, the daughter of Drusus, with Sejanus\r\nthe favourite, and minister of Trajan.  These fables, however,\r\nthough thus originating in special events, and designed at first\r\nto meet special circumstances, are so admirably constructed as to\r\nbe fraught with lessons of general utility, and of universal\r\napplication.  \r\n4 Hesiod.

Bayle has well put this in his account of Aesop.  \"Il n'y a\r\npoint d'apparence que les fables qui portent aujourd'hui son nom\r\nsoient les memes qu'il avait faites; elles viennent bien de lui\r\npour la plupart, quant a la matiere et la pensee; mais les\r\nparoles sont d'un autre.\"  And again, \"C'est donc a Hesiode, que\r\nj'aimerais mieux attribuer la gloire de l'invention; mais sans\r\ndoute il laissa la chose tres imparfaite.  Esope la perfectionne\r\nsi heureusement, qu'on l'a regarde comme le vrai pere de cette\r\nsorte de production.\"   M. Bayle.

There are two celebrated works which might\r\nby some be classed amongst works of this description.  The one is\r\nthe \"Speculum Sapientiae,\" attributed to St.  Cyril, Archbishop\r\nof Jerusalem, but of a considerably later origin, and existing\r\nonly in Latin.  It is divided into four books, and consists of\r\nlong conversations conducted by fictitious characters under the\r\nfigures  the beasts of the field and forest, and aimed at the\r\nrebuke of particular classes of men, the boastful, the proud, the\r\nluxurious, the wrathful, &c.  None of the stories are precisely\r\nthose of Aesop, and none have the concinnity, terseness, and\r\nunmistakable deduction of the lesson intended to be taught by\r\nthe fable, so conspicuous in the great Greek fabulist.  The exact\r\ntitle of the book is this:  \"Speculum Sapientiae, B.  Cyrilli\r\nEpiscopi:  alias quadripartitus apologeticus vocatus, in cujus\r\nquidem proverbiis omnis et totius sapientiae speculum claret et\r\nfeliciter incipit.\"  The other is a larger work in two volumes,\r\npublished in the fourteenth century by Caesar Heisterbach, a\r\nCistercian monk, under the title of \"Dialogus Miraculorum,\"\r\nreprinted in 1851.  This work consists of conversations in which\r\nmany stories are interwoven on all kinds of subjects.  It has no\r\ncorrespondence with the pure Aesopian fable.  \r\n12 Post-medieval Preachers, by S. Baring-Gould.  Rivingtons,\r\n1865.  \r\n13 For an account of this work see the Life of Poggio\r\nBracciolini, by the Rev.  William Shepherd.  Liverpool.  1801.  \r\n14 Professor Theodore Bergh.  See Classical Museum, No.  viii. \r\nJuly, 1849.  \r\n15 Vavassor's treatise, entitled \"De Ludicra Dictione\" was\r\nwritten A.D.  1658, at the request of the celebrated M. Balzac\r\n(though published after his death), for the purpose of showing\r\nthat the burlesque style of writing adopted by Scarron and\r\nD'Assouci, and at that time so popular in France, had no sanction\r\nfrom the ancient classic writers.  Francisci Vavassoris opera \r\nomnia. Amsterdam. 1709.  \r\n16 The claims of Babrias also found a warm advocate in the\r\nlearned Frenchman, M. Bayle, who, in his admirable dictionary,\r\n(Dictionnaire Historique et Critique de Pierre Bayle.  Paris,\r\n1820,) gives additional arguments in confirmation of the opinions\r\nof his learned predecessors, Nevelet and Vavassor.  \r\n17 Scazonic, or halting, iambics; a choliambic (a lame, halting\r\niambic) differs from the iambic Senarius in always having a\r\nspondee or trichee for its last foot; the fifth foot, to avoid\r\nshortness of meter, being generally an iambic.

Because it is unlikely that early remarks\r\nin authors like Herodotus, Aristophanes and Plato have no\r\nfoundation in reality, it can cautiously be said that Aesop\r\nwas a slave in the sixth century B.C., that he came from\r\nPhrygia and lived in Samos, and that he was known for his\r\nability to craft \"fables\" (logoi). The story that Aesop met\r\nhis end at Delphi, where he was sentenced to death and pushed\r\noff a cliff because he insulted the Delphians, is already\r\ncurrent in the fifth century B.C.\r\n\r\n   Today, everyone assumes that Aesop is a teller of fables who\r\nteaches morals to our children.  This Aesop is a modern\r\ninvention that reflects thousands of years of development. \r\nThe Aesop who has resulted is a figure of mythical\r\nproportions, to whom all fables are ascribed, much as we\r\nascribe all nursery rhymes to Mother Goose, even when these\r\nrhymes have a variety of disparate origins.\r\n\r\n   In ancient times, fables are not designed as moral tales for\r\nchildren.  Some are versions of famous fables we all know\r\n(\"The Tortoise and the Hare,\" \"The Ant and the Grasshopper,\"\r\n\"The Boy Who Called Wolf,\" \"The Lion's Share,\" etc.), but\r\nearly fables are more frequently designed to explain the\r\ncauses of natural phenomena, and ancient fables are\r\ncharacterized by a hard nosed realism which is at odds with\r\nthe view of the world that contemporary authors put in the\r\nmouth of Aesop.  The wisdom associated with the ancient fable\r\nis the kind of wisdom evident in Aesop's explanation of the\r\nfrustrating fact that weeds seem to grow more vigorously than\r\nthe seeds we plant, a fact he explains by saying that they are\r\nthe natural offspring of Mother Earth who nurtures them more\r\nfavourably, just as mothers favour their own children above\r\nall others.\r\n\r\n   When Socrates turns Aesop into verse as he is awaiting\r\nexecution, he seems attracted by their earthy wisdom.  The\r\nmost significant ancient thinkers who are attracted to the\r\nfable are, however, interested in exploiting them as\r\nrhetorical devices which can be used in persuading a public\r\naudience of some point of view. In keeping with this, the most\r\nimportant collector of ancient Aesopia is the philosopher\r\nDemetrius of Phalerum, who studied with Aristotle and became\r\nboth the ruler of Athens, the librarian at the Great\r\nAlexandrian library, and an important proponent of\r\nAristotelean rhetoric.\r\n\r\n   Though the real Aesop is obscure and inaccessible, we still\r\nhave an ancient account of him in a Life of Aesop\r\nwhich bears, in its earliest version, the title The Book\r\nof Xanthus the Philosopher and His Slave Aesop. According\r\nto this Life, Aesop was born an ugly mute slave, but\r\nwas granted the power to speak and craft fables in return for\r\nhis generosity to one of the attendants of the goddess Isis.\r\nHaving gained a knack for logoi, he engineered his way to\r\nSamos, where he became the slave of a philosopher called\r\nXanthus. In the course of recounting Aesop's life with\r\nXanthus, the Life implicates Aesop in a series of\r\nwild adventures, witty fables and obscene episodes which\r\ndemonstrate, above all else, that he can outwit and\r\nout-philosophize the philosopher who owns him.\r\n\r\n   Taken as a whole, the Life has a flavour reminiscent\r\nof Roman satire.  This has tried the patience of many authors,\r\nwhose exasperation is reflected in George Fyler Townsend's\r\nnineteenth century remark that \"This life... contains... so\r\nsmall an amount of truth, and is so full of absurd pictures of\r\nthe grotesque deformity of Aesop, of wondrous apocryphal\r\nstories, of lying legends, and gross anachronisms, that it is\r\nnow universally condemned as false, puerile, and unauthentic.\r\nIt is given up in the present day and unworthy of the\r\nslightest credit.\"  It is telling that such sentiments do not\r\nstop Townsend from including a version of the Life\r\nwithin his own popular collection of Aesop's fables.\r\n\r\n\tLeo Groarke\r\n\tWilfrid Laurier University\r\n\r\n\tReferences:\r\n\tLloyd Daly, Aesop Without Morals.
